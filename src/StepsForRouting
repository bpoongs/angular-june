to work with routes
--------------------
1) configure the route path for the components in the
   app-routing.module.ts
2) place the <router-outlet></router-outlet> tag on the component
   where you want the routed components to be displayed.

3 ways to route to a component
-------------------------------
1) type the route path in the url
2) use anchor tags with routerLink attribute instead of href attribute
	(so that the entire page doesnt get reloaded)
3) inject Router to the component from where you want to navigate and
	use this.router.navigate(['route-path']);
