steps for deploying angular application in docker.

1) build your angular application using the command
        ng build
2) create a dockerfile in your angular project folder and 
   copy the below contents into it.

   FROM nginx:1.17.7-alpine
    ## Remove default nginx website
    RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
    ## From 'builder' stage copy over the artifacts in 
    ##dist folder to default nginx public folder
    COPY /dist/angular-final-demo /usr/share/nginx/html
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

3) install docker in your laptop.
4) open a command prompt and navigate to your project folder
5) run the command to build your docker file to get the image.
        docker build . -t <imagename>
6) confirm whether the image is created by listing the images
        docker images
7) run the image with port mapping to create the container
        docker run -p 4444:80 <imagename>
8) open a browser and type the url "http://localhost:4444" to see the 
    the index page of your angular project deployed in nginx server in docker.
